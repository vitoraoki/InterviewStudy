# Introduction
Welcome to my study repository. This repository will be updated with the infos, links and codes that I use in my study journey. It will focus mainly in Algorithm and Android/KMM interviews. All the code is written in Kotlin (but it can change in the future if I change my mind hehehe). I hope it can be as useful to you as it is to me :)
